A space simulation web-app where users can create stars and planets and assemble them into solar systems. Construct your galaxy, piece-by-piece, and make it your own with custom landmarks and regions.

The current `index.html` explains our future tool, Space Builder, as well as its user stories. It is displayed in a Star Wars-inspired text scroll, with an option to disable the perspective. (You must enable JavaScript to use this feature.)
