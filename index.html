            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Space Builder</span class="highlight"> is a solar system simulation web-app, where users can create stars and planets and assemble them into solar systems.
                Users will submit basic information about their astronomical objects, and the application calculates additional detailed characteristics.
                Each planet will be visualized on a plot centered around the parent star, showing its distance and orbital path.
                For each planet in a system, the application will give a '<span class="highlight">habitability&nbsp;score</span class="highlight">,'
                ranking each planet by its likelihood to support life.
                Space Builder is not only educational, offering insights into various celestial bodies and the conditions for life,
                but also fun, as users watch their own systems come together, piece-by-piece.

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                There are many space simulators out there. However, many either focus on realistic physics simulation or are too
                occupied with visual sophistication. Our project aims to be a simple representation of what a star system looks like,
                in order to demonstrate the complex ways stars and planets interact. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, the:
                <cite><a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/my-solar-system" target="_blank">PhET 'My Solar System' simulation</a></cite>
                only addresses the effects of gravity between objects, and only allows limited elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand:
                <cite><a href="https://theskylive.com/3dsolarsystem">The Sky Live's simulator</a></cite>
                only demonstrates <em>our</em> solar system, and not the creation of unique, hypothetical systems to play around with.
            </p>
            <p>
                We intend to give a simplistic simulator for newcomers and enthusiasts alike.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The main interactive feature of this app is creation of astronomical bodies, starting with a star.
                The user will input basic information like the star's name and size, and the star will be placed on the plot, 
                resized and recolored according to the user's input. Afterwards, the user will input a similar form to create planets 
                to revolve around that star, similarly resized and recolored accordingly. A dashboard panel will display further information 
                about the selected star or planet, calculated from the user's form input, such as temperature, orbital period, rotational period, 
                and gravity strength. Once there are multiple elements in the system, the plot will display each element in its orbital cycle, 
                as well as the star's '<span class="highlight">habitable zone</span>'—the range of distances where life can exist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a user has finished constructing a star system, they will be prompted to '<span class="highlight">place</span>' the system somewhere within the empty galaxy,
                and once they choose a location, their progress will be saved and they can restore their system whenever they open the site.
                From this point on, the user can continue creating star systems and placing them on the galaxy map, with all previous star systems
                remaining on the map. The user will be able to place '<span class="highlight">landmark</span class="highlight">' points in the galaxy,
                as well as highlight areas of significance (such as a district, or an empire's jurisdiction).

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Users can create custom stars and planets within an isolated star system.
                This input is processed and various facts and other information is approximated, 
                    <br /> including but not limited to:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gravity strength</li>
                        <li>Year length</li>
                        <li>Day length</li>
                        <li>Temperature</li>
                        <li class="important-list-element highlight">Habitability score!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users can save solar systems that they create and load them back at a later time.
                    Saved systems are plotted on a galactic map at a particular location.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users can view a birds-eye view of the galaxy, containing all saved solar systems.
                    Additionally, users can place '<span class="highlight">landmarks</span>'
                    and draw '<span class="highlight">regions</span>', as well as give labels and descriptions for both.
                </li>
