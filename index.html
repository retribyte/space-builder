            <h2>Concept</h2>
            <p>
                Space Builder is a web application where users can create stars and planets and piece them together into solar systems.
                The user will submit basic information about their astronomical objects, and the application will calculate more detailed characteristics.
                Each planet will be visualized on a plot centered around the parent star, showing its distance and orbital path.
                For each planet in a system, the application will give a “habitability score,” ranking each planet by its likelihood to support life.
                Using this app users can also learn about different types of stars and planets and visualize what makes a planet viable to support life
                as well as have fun watching the planets thet made orbit around the stars they make.

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                The use case for this app is a user enters the webpage and sees a menu that allows them to make a star.
                This being their first option and then when they make their first star they will then be given the option
                to create a planet and define the information that will be used to give them what the likelihood of the planet supporting life.
                The type of users for this app is anyone that wants to make their own stars and planets.
                The type of information will all be user generated the user making all of the stars, planets and solar systems.
                The type of interaction the user can expect is making stars and planets and being able to watch them revolve around the stars they have made.
                This app will allow the user to learn about the inner working of solar systems and what different situations can lead to life.

                <li>
                    The user can also get a zoomed out view of the galaxy showing all of the solar systems they have made. 
                    As well as showing off a couple point of interest that also allow for the user to learn about those point of interest in the galaxy as well, as getting linked to the NASA page on that location in the galaxy.
